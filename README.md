## Questions

### Detailed formula for finding the slot of the dynamic struct

Please refer to the [Proof of concept](POC.md#detailed-formula-for-finding-the-slot-of-the-dynamic-struct) for the detailed formula.

### Details of decrypting Moloch-algorithm

Please refer to the [Proof of concept](POC.md#details-of-decrypting-moloch-algorithm) for the details of decrypting the Moloch-algorithm.

### Explain bypass for keccak256(abi.encodePacked())

Please refer to the [Proof of concept](POC.md#explain-bypass-for-keccak256abiencodepacked) for an explanation of the bypass.

## Proof of Concept

The repository contains two Solidity files that demonstrate a proof of concept for the Moloch's Vault CTF Challenge:

1. [MolochCaller.sol](./src/MolochCaller.sol) - A smart contract that interacts with the MolochVault contract to exploit the vulnerability.
2. [MOLOCH_VAULT.t.sol](./test/MOLOCH_VAULT.t.sol) - A test suite that demonstrates the exploit in action.

## Running Tests

To run the tests for this proof of concept, please use the following command:

```bash
forge test -vvvvv -f https://eth-goerli.public.blastapi.io
```
